 - implement options use_first_pass and try_first_pass, like
   the kerb5 module does (pb)

 - check what other "standard" options every pam module should
   offer (pb)

 - option for otpw-gen to generate only one single password (pb)

 - global config file; reduce the number of compile-time options (pb)

 - move .otpw out of home directory, such that user cannot
   recycle passwords (this requires otpw-gen to become setuid)

 - add generation time and (optional) expiry time to .otpw file (pb)
