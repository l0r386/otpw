<H2>Abstract</H2>

The OTPW package consists of the one-time-password generator
<CITE>newpass</CITE> plus two verification routines
<CITE>otpw_prepare()</CITE> and <CITE>otpw_verify()</CITE> that can
easily be added to programs such as <CITE>login</CITE> or
<CITE>ftpd</CITE> on POSIX systems. Login software extended this way
will allow reasonably secure user authentication over insecure network
lines. The user carries a password list on paper. The scheme is
designed to be robust against theft of the paper list and
race-for-the-last-letter attacks. Cryptographic hash values of the
one-time passwords are stored for verification in the user's home
directory.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>A well-known classic vulnerability of the Internet application
protocol suite is the frequent cleartext transfer of passwords in the
telnet, rsh, and ftp protocols. Modern replacements for these
protocols such as <A HREF="http://www.cs.hut.fi/~ylo">Tatu
Yl&ouml;nen</A>'s <A HREF="http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh/">ssh/scp</A>
allow comfortable and secure remote sessions and file transfers over
network connection that are not trusted to provide confidentiality.


<P>However, traveling computer users often want to connect to their
home system via untrusted terminals at conference hotels, other
universities, and airports, where trusted encryption software is not
available. A loss of confidentiality is often acceptable in these
situations for the session content, but never for the login passwords.
One-time-password schemes avoid the transmission of authentication
secrets that are of any value after they have been used. This provides
a reasonable level of protection against the widely encountered
password sniffing attacks. The goal of a one-time-password login
scheme is merely to provide a significant increase of security over
the classic telnet/rlogin login procedure. It does
<STRONG>not</STRONG> aim to protect from sophisticated active attacks
such as session hijacking, host emulation, man-in-the-middle, etc.
against which ssh and SSL based protocols should be used if this level
of protection is required.

<P>A widely known one-time-password scheme is <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cert.dfn.de/pub/tools/password/SKey/">S/KEY</A>
[Hal94, HM96]. OTPW is not compatible with and is not derived from
S/KEY or <A HREF=
"ftp://ftp.cert.dfn.de/pub/tools/password/nrl-opie/">OPIE</A>. It is a
completely independent and different design, of which I believe that
it fulfils my functional and security requirements better.

<H2>How it works</H2>

<P>One-time password authentication with the OTPW package is
accomplished via a file <CITE>.otpw</CITE> that is located in the
user's home directory. No state is kept in any system-wide files,
therefore OTPW does not introduce any new setuid root programs. As
long as a user does not have <CITE>.otpw</CITE> in her home directory,
the one-time-password facility has not been activated for her.

<P>A user who wants to setup the one-time-password capability just
executes the <CITE>newpass</CITE> program. The program will ask for a
<EM>prefix password</EM> that the user has to select and memorize and
it will then write to standard output a password list such as:

  !!! DO NOT FORGET TO ENTER PREFIX PASSWORD FIRST !!!
</PRE>

<P>Normally the output of <CITE>newpass</CITE> should be sent directly to
the printer as in

<PRE>
  newpass | lpr
</PRE>

<P>or should be first formatted with an ASCII to PostScript converter
where necessary.

<P>Get the printed list immediately from the printer, fold it, and
keep it with you. The list shows the machine name and the creation
time to allow users to find the latest list for the right machine. It
does not show the user's name, as nobody is supposed to have the list
of anyone else. Only a single list is required for a set of networked
machines on which the user has a common home directory.

<P>By default, <CITE>newpass</CITE> generates 60 lines of output, but
the command line options <SAMP>-l</SAMP>&nbsp;<VAR>lines</VAR> or
<SAMP>-n</SAMP>&nbsp;<VAR>passwords</VAR> allow to specify the length
of the output. No more than 1000 passwords will be generated at a
time.

<P>When a one-time-password authentication is desired instead of a
normal authentication at login, then the user just appends a slash (/)
to the user name. The password prompt will then be preceded by a
3-digit password number. The password that has now to be entered is
the prefix password that was given to <CITE>newpass</CITE>, followed
directly (without hitting return between) by the password with the
requested number from the printed password list:

<PRE>
  login: <B>kuhn/</B>
  013 Password: <B>geHeimBcS8/fN%j7o4</B>
</PRE>

<P>In this example, <SAMP>geHeim</SAMP> was the prefix password. The
spaces in the password list are just there to increase readability and
do not have to be entered by the user.

<P>A clever attacker might observe the password being entered and
might try to use the fact that computers can send data much faster
than users can finish entering passwords. In the several hundred
milliseconds that the user needs to enter the last character and press
the enter key, an attacker could simultaneously open 64 connections to
the machine and simply try all 64 possible last characters. This way
an attacker could get a login faster than the user.

<P>To prevent such a race-for-the-last-letter attack, any login
attempt that is taking place concurrently with another attempt will
require three one-time passwords to be entered:

<PRE>
  login: <B>kuhn/</B>
  012/021/010 Password: <B>geHeimSMF/EmLn=J6sDjWpR9Kf32yM3FPYUfU8Z53C</B>
</PRE>

<P>This might look inconvenient at first, but remember that three
passwords will only be requested when someone tries to login
simultaneously, which in itself should already cause suspicion. The
three requested passwords are randomly selected but they will never
include the single password that was requested in the first of the
concurrent login attempts. Only the first requested single password
will be locked, not any of the requested triples. This way, the
three-password method ensures that an attacker cannot disable the OTPW
mechanism by locking all passwords. The triple challenge ensures that
in the order of a million network connections would be necessary to
perform a race attack, which is not practical. The OTPW package
creates a symbolic link <SAMP>.otpw.lock</SAMP> in the user's home
directory to lock the first requested password while its input is
pending. If a system crash created a stale lock, it will be removed
after 24 hours.

<P>The <SAMP>.otpw</SAMP> file looks like

<P>The first line identifies the file format and the second line shows
the number of originally generated password entries. Every further
line is the <A HREF=
"http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html">RIPEMD-160</A>
hash value of the prefix password concatenated with one of the printed
one-time passwords. Only the first 72 bits of the hash value encoded
in the same modified base64 encoding that was used to generate the
passwords is stored there. As soon as a one-time password has been
entered correctly, the corresponding <SAMP>.otpw</SAMP> line will be
overwritten with 12 hyphens to prevent any reuse of this password.

<H2>Installation</H2>

<P>Get the OTPW package <SAMP>otpw-?.?.tar.gz</SAMP> from <A
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/">
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/</A>.

<P>First have a look into <SAMP>conf.h</SAMP> where some system
parameters can be changed. The only item there really worth being
checked carefully is the <SAMP>ENTROPY_CMDS</SAMP> macro. It contains
a list of shell commands, whose output is used to initialize the
random number generator in <CITE>newpass</CITE>. Make sure that at
least most of these shell commands actually do work on your system and
produce an output that is extremely difficult to predict for potential
attackers. If your operating system has a <SAMP>/dev/random</SAMP> or
<SAMP>/dev/urandom</SAMP> device that gives access to a good true
random number generator, then make sure that a command reads and
outputs around 20 bytes from there. In <SAMP>ENTROPY_ENV</SAMP>, some
environment variables (e.g., <SAMP>PATH</SAMP>) can be set for these
shell commands.

<P>Just start <CITE>make</CITE> to compile the <CITE>newpass</CITE>
and <CITE>demologin</CITE> programs. While <CITE>newpass</CITE> can
directly be made available to the user, <CITE>demologin</CITE> is only
an example of the modifications that you have to make to your login
program to support one-time passwords using OTPW.

<P>The login program has to call

<PRE>
  #include "otpw.h"

  struct challenge ch;
  struct passwd *pwd;

  otpw_prepare(&amp;ch, pwd);
</PRE>

<P>after the user name has been entered and the POSIX password
database entry has been read into <SAMP>*pwd</SAMP>. The routine will
select a challenge password, which will be stored in
<SAMP>ch.challenge</SAMP>, and will lock it if necessary. If this was
not possible, for instance because the user has no unused passwords
left, then <SAMP>ch.challenge</SAMP> will be an empty string.
Otherwise, <SAMP>ch.challenge</SAMP> should be displayed to the user
in some way before the password prompt. After the password has been
entered, call

<PRE>
  result = otpw_verify(&amp;ch, password);
</PRE>

<P>and if <SAMP>result == OTPW_OK</SAMP> then accept the user as
authorized, otherwise do not. It is very important that
<SAMP>otpw_verify()</SAMP> is always called after
<SAMP>otpw_prepare()</SAMP> has returned successfully (i.e., with a
non-empty <SAMP>ch.challenge</SAMP> string), as otherwise a stale lock
might remain set. In <SAMP>otpw_prepare()</SAMP>, the current working
directory will be changed to the user's home directory, and
<SAMP>otpw_verify()</SAMP> expects that it is still there. If after
<SAMP>otpw_verify()</SAMP> has returned, the condition
<SAMP>ch.entries > 2 * ch.remaining</SAMP> is true and half of all
passwords have been used, the user should be remembered to generate a
new password list by executing <CITE>newpass</CITE>. The security of
OTPW is increased if a new password list is created long before all
passwords on the old list have been used.

<P>Both routines can be called with the <SAMP>root</SAMP> user id and
they will temporarily change the effective user-id to that of the user
in order to access the password file in the home directory. OTPW does
not use any of the POSIX advisory file locking system calls, as those
often do not work reliably over network file systems.


<H2>Design Rationale</H2>

<P>Unlike S/KEY [Hal94, HM96], OTPW is not based on the Lamport scheme
[Lam77] in which every one-time password is the one-way hash value of
its successor. Password lists based on the Lamport scheme have the
problem that if the attacker can see one of the last passwords on the
list, that then all previous passwords can be calculated from it. We
also do not store the encrypted passwords as suggested by Rubin
[Rub96], in order to keep the host free of files with secrets. Both
proposals aimed to save memory in the host system. Instead, we store
the one-way hash value of every single password in a potentially
widely readable file in the user's home directory. For instance, hash
values of 240 passwords (a typical A4 page) require only a 3134 byte
long <SAMP>.otpw</SAMP> file of the user's disk quota. This is
completely negligible in a typical environment (much less than 1 cent
annual storage cost).

<P>The passwords are carefully generated random numbers. The random
number generator is based on the RIPEMD-160 secure hash function
[DBP96, ISO96]. The random number generator is seeded by hashing
together the output of various shell commands. These provide
unpredictability in the form of a system random number seed, access
times of important system files, usage history of the host, in case of
an X11 system the screen content, and more. The random state is the
160-bit output of the hash function. The random state is iterated
after each use by concatenating the old state with the current
high-resolution timer output and hashing the result again. The first
72 bits of the hash output are encoded with a modified base64 [FB96]
scheme to produce readable passwords, while the remaining 88 bits
represent the undisclosed internal state of the random number
generator.

<P>In many fonts, the characters 0/O or 1/l/I are difficult to
distinguish, therefore the modified base64 encoding replaces the three
characters 01l by :=%. If for instance a zero is confused with a
capital O by the user, the password verification routine will
automatically correct for this.

<P>While S/KEY uses sequences of short English words as passwords,
OTPW uses a base64 encoding, because it allows more passwords to be
printed on a single page. In addition, an average human spy needs over
30 seconds to write a 12-character random string into short-term
memory, which provides a good protection against brief looks that an
attacker might have on a password list. Lists of short words on the
other hand are much faster to memorize.

<P>The prefix password ensures that neither stealing the password list
nor eavesdropping the line alone can provide unauthorized access.
Admittedly, the security obtained by OTPW is not comparable with that
of a challenge-response system in which the user has a PIN protected
special calculator that generates the response. On the other hand, a
piece of paper is much more portable, much more robust, and much
cheaper than a special calculator. OTPW was designed for the large
user base, for which an extra battery-powered device is inconvenient
or not cost effective and who therefore still use normal Unix
passwords everywhere.

<P>In contrast to the proposal in RFC 1938, OTPW does not lock more
than one one-time password at a time. If we did this, an attacker
could easily exhaust our list of unlocked passwords and force us to
either not login at all or use the normal Unix login password.
Therefore, OTPW locks only one single password and for all further
logins a triple-challenge is issued. If more than 100 unused passwords
remain available, then there are over a million different challenges
and an attacker has very little chance to perform a successful race
attack while the authorized user finishes password entry.

<P>Special thanks to Kan Zhang (Cambridge) for useful suggestions. The
RIPEMD-160 routine was provided by Antoon Bosselaers (Katholieke
Universiteit Leuven).
