OTPW revision history
---------------------

Changes in version 1.1 (2003-06-19)

  - added pam_otpw module (with assistance from Steven Murdoch)

Changes in version 1.2 (2003-08-31)

  - added English 4-letter-word password option

  - converted several compile-time options into run-time options

Changes in version 1.3 (2003-09-30)

  - added new option -s to otpw-gen

  - added code to otpw.c to handle a comment line starting with '#'
    as the second line (this is not yet used by otpw-gen)

  - fixed a string manipulation bug (not security critical)
    in otpw.c (reported by Nicolas Pougetoux)

  - a few more minor bug fixes and stylistic improvements

Changes in version 1.4 (2004-03-??)

  - removed upper limit for entropy, i.e. passwords can now be
    practically arbitrarily long (option -e)

  - new option -o to disable the random permutation of passwords in
    the ~/.otpw file, such that they are requested in the order
    printed on the paper

  - new option -n to suppress the 4-line header and footer on each
    printed page

  - at least one column of passwords will always be printed, even with
    option -w 0

  - new option -r suggests one random password to stdout, then exists

  - new password format that uses only lowercase letters and digits (-p 3),
    means to be easy to communicate via voice

  - new option -m to generate passwords from a single randomly generated
    key, which will be printed to stderr

  - new option -k to recreate a password list from a master key generated
    with -m. This does not affect the ~/.otpw file

  - new options -E and -P to control the entropy and form of the
    master key generated with -m
