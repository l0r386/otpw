.SH NAME
otpw-gen \- one-time password generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B otpw-gen
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I OTPW
is a one-time password authentication system. It can be plugged into
any application that needs to authenticate users interactively.
One-time password authentication is a valuable protection against
keyboard and network sniffing attacks, especially for logins from
untrusted terminals.

Before you can use
.I OTPW
to log into your system, two preparation steps are necessary. Firstly,
a system administrator has to enable it. This is usually done by
configuring your login software (e.g., sshd) to use
.I OTPW
via the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) configuration files
in /etc/pam.d/.

Secondly, you need to generate a list of one-time passwords and print
it out. This can be done by calling
.IP
.B otpw-gen | lpr
.PP
You will be asked for a
.IR "prefix password" ,
which you need to memorize. It has to be entered immediately before
the one-time password and prevents anyone who finds your password
printout can use it to impersonate you.

Each one-time password will be printed behind a three digit password
number. Such a number will appear in the password prompt when
.I OTPW
has been activated:
.IP
.B Password 026:
.PP
When you see this prompt, enter the memorized prefix password,
followed immediately by the one-time password identified by the
number. Any spaces within a password have only been inserted to
improve legibility and do not have to be copied.
.I OTPW
will ignore the difference between the easily confused characters
.B 0O
and
.B Il1
in passwords.

In some situations, for example if multiple logins occur
simultaneously for the same user,
.I OTPW
defends itself against the possibility of various attacks by asking
for three random passwords simultaneously.
.IP
.B Password 047/192/210:
.PP
You then have to enter the prefix password immediately followed by the
three given one-time passwords. This fall-back mode is activated by
the existence of the lock file
.BR ~/.otpw.lock .
If it was left over by some malfunction, it can safely be deleted
manually.

Call
.B otpw-gen
again when you have used up about half of the printed one-time
passwords or when you have lost your password sheet. This will disable
all remaining passwords on the previous sheet.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 14
.BI \-h " number"
Specify the total number of lines to be sent to standard output.
This number minus four header lines determines the number of rows in the
printed password matrix. It is reduced automatically to never print more
than 1000 passwords. (Default: 60)
.TP
.BI \-w " number"
Specify the maximum width of lines to be sent to standard output.
This parameter determines together with the password length the number
of columns in the printed password matrix. (Default: 79)
.TP
.BI \-s " number"
Specify the length of each one-time password in characters. Each
character carries 6 bits of information. Supported values are in the
range from 4 to 13. (Default: 8, i.e. 48 bits entropy)
.TP
.BI \-f " filename"
Specify a file to be used instead of
.I ~/.otpw
for storing the hash values of the generated one-time passwords.
