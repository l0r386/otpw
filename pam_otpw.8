.TH PAMOTPW 1 "2003-06-24"
.SH NAME
pam_otpw \- verify one-time passwords
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pam_otpw
[
.I arguments
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I OTPW
is a one-time password authentication system. It compares entered
passwords with hash values stored in the user's home directory in the
file
.BR ~/.otpw .
Once a password was entered correctly, its hash value in
.B ~/.otpw
will be overwritten with hyphens, which disables its use in future
authentication. A lock file
.B ~/.otpw.lock
prevents that the same password challenge is issued on several
concurrent authentication sessions. This helps to prevent an
eavesdropper from copying a one-time password as it is entered
instantly into a second session, in the hope to get access by sending
the final newline character faster than the user could.

Both an authentication management and a session management function
are offered by this module. The authentication function asks for and
verifies one-time passwords. The session function prints a message
after login that reminds the user of the remaining number of one-time
passwords.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP debug
Turn on debugging via \fBsyslog(3)\fR.
.IP nolock
Disable locking. This option tells the authentication function of
.I pam_otpw.so
to ignore any existing
.B ~/.otpw.lock
lock file and not to generate any. With this option,
.I pam_otpw.so
will never ask for several passwords simultaneously.
